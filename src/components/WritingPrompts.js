    "Set your story in a remote winter cabin with no electricity, internet, or phone service.", "Write about a character who is incapable of telling even the smallest lie or half-truth.", "Write about someone who doesn’t remember their past — and doesn’t want to.",
    "Write about the most creepy/unexplainable moment you've ever experienced. Who was there? What happened? Embellishments are encouraged!", "Write about a character who finds an odd-looking egg in the forest. When they take it home, they never could have predicted what was inside it.",
    "Write a book about a character who is fortunate to have been born into a powerful family after the downfall of the world. They have everything they would ever hope to have…except for a clue as to what happens outside their very large, protective walls. Once they find out, they can’t help but need to change it.",
    "Tagged, chipped, and shuffled into line. That’s your character’s everyday reality. They’re herded like cattle…to be used in the same way as cattle. Then a single guard takes pity on your character and offers them a way out.",
    "Write a story about a character who’s in an accident that leaves them blind. When they meet a stranger who shows them how to enjoy life again, everything seems to be perfect. Until tragedy strikes that stranger.",

    "Write a list of 10 things you know to be true", "Write about your favorite childhood memory. Give explicit details; who was present? Where were you? What did you see/smell/hear? Why did it impact you so deeply?", "What inspires you?", "What scares you?", "What makes you angry? How can you use that anger constructively? How could that anger destroy you?"
